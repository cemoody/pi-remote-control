/**
 * audit-ci-test-coverage — fail-fast gate that ensures every test file
 * under tests/ is actually wired into a job in .github/workflows/ci.yml.
 *
 * Why this exists: a new tests/<bucket>/foo.test.ts that nobody added to
 * the workflow is dead code in disguise — it never runs in PR review,
 * never blocks merge, never catches the regression it was written for.
 * This script enumerates the test files, buckets them by directory, and
 * checks ci.yml contains the matching job + invocation. Runs as part of
 * the typecheck-and-unit job (see package.json `audit:ci-tests`).
 *
 * Exit code: 0 = healthy, 1 = at least one test file or workflow snippet
 * is missing.
