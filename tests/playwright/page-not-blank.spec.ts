/**
 * "The page must not go blank" smoke suite, run in CI.
 *
 * Pins the user-facing invariant that brought us here: loading any
 * session URL should leave the React shell mounted and the workspace
 * usable — even for sessions whose payload contains a shape that some
 * future renderer doesn't expect. The original symptom of this class
 * of bug (session 019e4de3-… via PR #110 / #111) was: title + sidebar
 * render for ~hundred ms, then the entire body unmounts and the page
 * is blank, with no recovery short of a hard refresh.
 *
 * The protection is two-layer (safe-markdown coercion + a scoped
 * SessionContentErrorBoundary). This suite verifies the OBSERVABLE
 * outcome of both layers together for every seeded session — so a
 * regression in either, or a new render path that bypasses both,
 * shows up as a CI failure rather than a silent production blank.
 *
 * For each seeded session it asserts:
 *
 *   1. The composer is mounted (sentinel for "shell still rendered").
 *   2. The sidebar is mounted with at least one entry (sentinel for
 *      "navigation still works; user can leave a bad session").
 *   3. The body text is non-trivial (rules out the literal "everything
 *      under root unmounted to whitespace" failure mode).
 *   4. No `pageerror` with a `react-markdown` / `Unexpected value for
 *      \`children\`` signature escaped (the original crash we shipped a
 *      fix for; if the boundary caught it that's still a regression in
 *      the source-of-bad-data path and we want CI to notice).
 *
 * Crucially this test is data-driven from the seed script — adding a
 * new seeded session shape automatically extends coverage.
