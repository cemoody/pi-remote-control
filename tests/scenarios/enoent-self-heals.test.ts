/**
 * Scenario (Feature B — self-healing registry):
 *
 *   Reproduces the 2026-05-29 "dead handle" class. A session is open and
 *   registered with the API. Its detached worker dies (crash / OOM / manual
 *   kill) and its unix socket goes away — but the API still holds a live
 *   registration pointing at that dead socket. Re-opening the session returns
 *   the stale handle and dials the dead socket, yielding:
 *
 *       500 "Pi RPC supervisor connection is closed"
 *       (or, with a missing socket file, connect ENOENT /tmp/.../<hash>.sock)
 *
 *   and it does NOT recover on subsequent opens — every open re-hits the dead
 *   handle. In production this manifested as a session that was permanently
 *   "unhealthy" until the whole API was bounced.
 *
 *   The robust contract we want (Feature B):
 *     - getOrOpenSession detects a dead/closed handle (pid not alive OR socket
 *       not connectable) and transparently RE-SPAWNS a fresh worker, returning
 *       200 — the session self-heals on next access.
 *     - the registry never serves a handle whose worker is gone.
 *     - no stale sockets are left with no listener.
 *
 * Status: GREEN as of Feature B (self-healing registry). This file is now the
 * permanent regression guard for that fix.
 *
 * Two sub-cases:
 *   A) API stays up, worker dies   → stale live registration (the core bug)
 *   B) API restarts after worker dies → reattach must reconcile, not re-dial
